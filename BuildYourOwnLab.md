# Build Your Own Lab

## Overview 
The *Build your Own Lab* lab is for ISQA8300 students. For this lab, follow the format that we have been using over course of the semester. 
The only difference is that you can build the lab using just text and a pdf. You do not need to create the lab in markdown.

For the lab, use AWS Educate for exploring new technologies that we did not use this semester. The lab should be written so as to guide a future student through things. 
It should include pictures, descriptions, and necessary commands to complete the lab. 

Scope the lab such that it could be completed in under one hour for people unfamiliar with your chosen technology. 
You can get a full and comprehensive set of available AWS services at: https://awseducate-starter-account-services.s3.amazonaws.com/AWS_Educate_Starter_Account_Services_Supported.pdf
