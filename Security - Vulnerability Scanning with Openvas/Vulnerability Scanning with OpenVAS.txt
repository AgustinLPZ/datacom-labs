IMPORTANT: Be sure to record the password that is generated for the admin user.




OpenVAS Setup and Starting the OpenVAS Service
----------------------------------------------

/etc/init.d/openvas-scanner status
/etc/init.d/openvas-manager status
/etc/init.d/openvas-administrator status



Open the OpenVAS web interface by going to https://127.0.0.1:9392

Login with the user `admin` and the password generated previously.

If you closed the terminal window without getting the password, or you simply want to change the password, use the following command in the terminal.

```
openvasmd --user=admin --new-password=new_password
```
