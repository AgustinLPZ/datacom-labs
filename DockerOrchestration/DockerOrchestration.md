# Overview 

For this lab, we are going to be continuing into the Docker world. In this lab, we are going to be exploring Docker Orchestration using Docker Swarm. Take a look at the posted slide deck for a better handle on what Docker Swarm and Orchestration is all about. But it's safe to say that Orchestration is about having a manager node and worker nodes that can be assembled into a cluser and services (and tasks) can be deployed in this cluster to help with uptime and redundancy in a system. 

For this lab, you will be deploying three AWS instances -- all with docker on them. There will be one Manager instance and two Worker instances. You'll have to take a bit of care in how you set up these instances. Whatever the case, let's get started and start checking out Container Orchestration. 

First, you are going to need to launch three (3) new AWS instances.
