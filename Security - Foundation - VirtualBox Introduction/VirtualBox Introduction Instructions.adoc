= VirtualBox Introduction

Your computer has an operating system (OS), probably Windows, Mac OS, or a version of Linux. Software exists that allows you to run another OS while your main OS is still running. For example, with a Windows laptop, you could run Ubuntu Linux as if it were another application on your computer. Your Windows OS would be the "host," and the Ubuntu Linux OS would be the "guest." In this case, the guest is not connecting to your hardware directly, but virtually, and is therefore called a virtual machine. Virtual machines run on virtualization software that makes the system hardware and host platform agnostic.

There are several software platforms that allow you to run virtual machines. At the enterprise level, Microsoft's Hyper-V and VMWare ESX allow professionals to deploy virtual machines inside data centers. With these platforms, there is no host OS; the virtual machines run on the server hardware with on a thin virtualization layer between the operating system and the hardware. Virtualization is quickly become the de-facto option for deploying servers in an enterprise environment.

Virtualization options exist for desktop users who want to run guest operating systems. The guest operating systems can be used for software development, testing software exploits, or learning about different operating systems. By default, the guest operating system cannot affect the host operating system. Guest operating systems can be configured to interact with the host operating system by sharing write access to specific folders, but a guest operating system will never make configuration changes to the host operating system. Basically, you can run guest operating systems without worrying about messing up your computer.

== Prerequisites

None. VirtualBox runs on all major operating systems.

== Download and Install VirtualBox

VirtualBox is a an excellent open source tool for running virtual machines on your system. It has an added advantage in that it is free. We will use Virtualbox for all of the labs in this course to demonstrate and try out networking concepts. 

* Open https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads
* Download the latest version of VirtualBox for Windows hosts (or your computer's primary operating system if it is not Windows)
* Install VirtualBox when the download completes

== Launch VirtualBox

* Launch VirtualBox

* The first time you use VirtualBox, you will probably not see any virtual machines. In the screenshot below, several virtual machines have been created.

== Verify Operating System Support

* In VirtualBox, click `New` to start the virtual machine creation process.

* Click the `Version` drop-down to see what operating system versions are available. If you see 32 and 64 bit operating system versions (as shown in the following screenshot), skip the Enable Virtualization section.

== Enable Virtualization

If you do NOT see 64 bit options available in VirtualBox, you need to update your computer settings. The BIOS controls whether or not your operating system can take advantage of certain hardware features. Some computers are configured to deny virtualization extensions, which prevents VirtualBox from running correctly. Take care when updating your BIOS. Only change settings if you understand the ramifications of the chagnes. Turning on virtualization in the BIOS is safe, but changing other settings (such as overclocking your RAM or CPU) can actually damage the hardware.

* First, you need to check your BIOS settings. You must restart your computer and (depending on your computer) press F1, F2, or the DELETE key to enter the BIOS configuration. Basically, you can just start hitting those keys as soon as your computer begins the boot process. If you see the Windows logo, you did not hit the keys soon enough.
    * If you are having trouble getting into your BIOS, see this article: http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/enter-bios-computer/.
* In your BIOS, you will need to enable virtualization.
* Save the changes to your BIOS and exit. Allow your computer to boot normally.
* Once your computer has booted, start VirtualBox and ensure that 64 bit operating systems are available.
