= Data Communications Lab Exercises

These labs are produced as a collaborative effort to provide hands-on activities for courses in data communications.
They are a way for learners to interact with networking principles and technologies without the need for expensive and specialized network hardware.
Using these labs and freely available software, you can create (sort of) functioning networks on your computer.
