Nmap is a tool to scan for open ports. Nessus is a program that not only scans ports, but can look for vulnerabilities in a remote system.

Prerequisites
----------------
Kali VM created in VirtualBox
Metasploitable VM created in VirtualBox

VM Setup
-----------------
1. Start Kali. Make sure the IP address is 192.168.2.10. Use the username `root` and the password `toor` as needed to login.
2. Start Metasploitable. Make sure the IP address is 192.168.2.50. Use the `msfadmin` for the username and password if needed.
3. Ensure that Kali can ping Metasploitable. If there are problems, ensure that the following requirements are met:
  - Both VMs are in the 192.168.2.0/24 network.
  - Both VMs are configured in the VirtualBox Manager to use "Internal Networking" for their network adapters.

Start Nessus
----------------
1. In Kali, run the following command to start the Nessus service.

```
/etc/init.d/nessusd start
```

2. Run the following command n Kali to ensure that the Nessus service started correctly.

```
ps -eaf | grep nessus | grep -v grep
```

The command lists processes with `nessus` in the name, but excludes the `grep` process itself.

3. Launch the Iceweasel web browser.

4. Open https://localhost:8834/flash.html

5. Login with root/toor.
