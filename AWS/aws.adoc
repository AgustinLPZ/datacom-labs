This lab will help you get oriented with Amazon Web Services. This will give you exposure to the environment that we will be using the for the remainder of the class. 

== Learning Objectives

This lab is meant to get you to start interacting with your AWS Educate account. In particular, we will be exploring the specific technologies that the rest of our labs will be based on. In these labs, I ask that you (1) follow the instructions below, (2) provide screen shots of your work, (3) provide a brief (1-2 sentence) description of what you are seeing, and (4) submit your screen shots and descriptions as a single PDF document to Canvas. '

In each of these cases, you will perhaps need to do a little more research as to what the technologies are. In all cases, focus your description on what the technology is. Your answer certainly won't be perfect and we will learn more as we interact with the technologies throughout the semester. However, please make an attempt as to what you believe each technology to be -- either through the descriptions on AWS or as found elsewhere on the internet. 

== Steps

=== Step 1: Login to your AWS Account

By this point, you have received an invitation from me to login to your AWS Educate account. From this, you will be able to explore the various technologies that you have available through AWS, as well as see the technologies that we'll be using throughout the semester. For this step take a screen shot of your AWS Console page
