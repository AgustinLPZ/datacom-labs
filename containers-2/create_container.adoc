Welcome to your last lab in 3400! Yes, we are at the end of the (strange) semester. Well done everyone. I'm sorry that I didn't get to spend more time with you in class. I really enjoying working on these labs with all of you... and I enjoy doing this in person. 

For this final lab, you are going to be using Docker again and, quite simply, you are going to be building a container that contains a Python script. The idea is to get you to see how you could package an application into a container that would ultimately be available for others. We are not going to be placing the container in any sort of registry, we are simply going to be making it on an AWS instance. Let's get started. 

First things first. Build an instance on AWS. There is nothing special about this instance. The only thing that you need to confirm in the Security Settings is that you can SSH into the machine. I think this is a default setting anyway. Once you are logged into your AWS instance, make sure that docker is installed and started: 

> sudo yum -y install docker 

> sudo service docker start 

From here, we are going write the smallest Python script that we will place into a Docker container. In your current folder: 

> sudo nano helloworld.py

When inside nano, type: 

> print("hello world. Python for Docker!")

Exit nano and run the Python script at the command line: 

> python helloworld.py

This should simply print the line that you just typed. 




> sudo docker images

.Docker Images

Now, we can do our first Docker image installation with the following command. Notice that it tries to run things locally but because it is not avaialble, it downloads it from the online registry. Also notice the PULL statement in the text as Hello-World is PULLED from the repository. 

> sudo docker run hello-world 

.Hello World
image::5.png[HelloWorld]

{nbsp} +
{nbsp} +

Now type: 

> sudo docker images

You should see the hello-world image in the list. 

But what else is available? Go and check out Docker Hub (https://hub.docker.com/search?type=image). You can search for Apache (yes, well just keep sticking with a known application for simplicity sake but you could substitute Apache for any other container). 

.ApacheOnDockerHub

> sudo docker run -dit --name web-3400 -p 8080:80 -v /home/user/website/:/usr/local/apache2/htdocs/ httpd:latest

Once you run this run: 

> sudo docker images

You will see your latest downloaded Apache container (and it's already running). Change to the local directory at: 

> cd /home/user/website 

And make an index.html file. Then navigate to your IP address (get this from your AWS console) and goto your IPADDRESS:8080.

Once you've seen your server running, remember that it is running in a container, not natively on your AWS instance. Run the command to see your containers on your instance: 

> sudo docker ps -a 

.ShowContainers
image::8.png[ShowContainers]

Finally, we can login to our Apache container. Note that this IS differnet from a VM as it is using the same resources as the native AWS instance that you are on. It is just an assigned (and shared) space on the computer. 

> sudo docker exec -it web-3400 /bin/bash

If you do the following: 

> pwd 

You'll see your present working directory in the container. Then do: 

> ls 

You'll see a folder called htdocs. CD into that folder and do: 

> ls 

You'll see the index file you created in an earlier step but you can't modifiy it here. Why? Because you aren't really supposed to modify containers in production. They are meant to be self-contained applications in containers that you can ship to people and make sure that they work everywhere. If you let people modify things, like configuration files, it starts to defeat the purpose of containerization. That's the end of this intro to containers!

QUESTIONS TO CONSIDER FOR THE FINAL: 

* How is a container different from a virtual machine? 
* Why would I want to create a containerized application that is available to others to use?
