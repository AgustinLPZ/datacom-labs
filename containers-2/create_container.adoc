Welcome to your last lab in 3400! Yes, we are at the end of the (strange) semester. Well done everyone. I'm sorry that I didn't get to spend more time with you in class. I really enjoying working on these labs with all of you... and I enjoy doing this in person. 

For this final lab, you are going to be using Docker again and, quite simply, you are going to be building a container that contains a Python script. The idea is to get you to see how you could package an application into a container that would ultimately be available for others. We are not going to be placing the container in any sort of registry, we are simply going to be making it on an AWS instance. Let's get started. 

First things first. Build an instance on AWS. There is nothing special about this instance. The only thing that you need to confirm in the Security Settings is that you can SSH into the machine. I think this is a default setting anyway. Once you are logged into your AWS instance, make sure that docker is installed and started: 

> sudo yum -y install docker 

> sudo service docker start 

From here, we are going write the smallest Python script that we will place into a Docker container. In your current folder: 

> sudo nano helloworld.py

When inside nano, type: 

> print("hello world. Python for Docker!")

Exit nano and run the Python script at the command line: 

> python helloworld.py

This should simply print the line that you just typed. Easy enough so far. The point of this is that you are able to build an applicant on your local machine and ultimately place it into a Docker container, ensuring that it can be run on ANY system using Docker. Naturally, you will likely build more complex applications than helloworld but we're simply trying to see how this process would begin. Packaging a larger applicant into a Docker container is a bit more complex but follows similar logic to what we are doing here. 

Now, let's get the simple Python application into a container. To do this, we first need to create a Dockerfile: 

> sudo touch Dockerfile

This will create an empty Dockerfile. It is this file that will enable us to create a container. The next step is to edit the file: 

> sudo nano Dockerfile

Type (copy) and save the following: 

....

#Make sure that the use of the Container will always download the publicly available docker image "python" on Docker Hub. 
FROM python

#Creating directory helloworld in the container
RUN mkdir /home/helloworld

#Copying helloworld.py from our local directory to container's helloworld directory
COPY helloworld.py /home/helloworld/helloworld.py

#running helloworld.py in container
CMD python /home/helloworld/helloworld.py

....

Now, back at the command line, make sure that the Dockerfile is executable with the following command: 

> sudo chmod 755 Dockerfile 

Now, let's build the container with: 

> sudo docker build -t 3400app .

You can now run the applicaiton in the Docker container: 

> sudo docker run 3400app

You should see the helloword results! Nicely done. You can view the container with: 

> sudo docker ps -a 

Finally, do the following (1) Modify your helloworld.py file to say some additional things, (2) Run your Docker container again (you'll see no change in your updated Python script), (3) rebuild your container with teh build statement above, (4) rerun your container and you'll see the changes reflected

QUESTION TO CONSIDER FOR THE FINAL: 

* Why did you need to rebuild the container to see the local changes to your Python script?
