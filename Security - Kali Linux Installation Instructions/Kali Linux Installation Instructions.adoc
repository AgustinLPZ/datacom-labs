7) After the virtual machine has been creted, right-click on the Kali VM, choose Settings > Network. Change Adapter 1 from `NAT` to `Internal Network`. Click `OK` to save the settings. The Internal Network option allows your VM to communicate with other virtual machines on the host, but it does not allow you to connect to the Internet.

== Basic Kali Configuration

Kali will boot up without any installation required.

1. At the login screen, click and drag up to unlock the window.
2. For the user, enter `root`.
3. The password is `toor` (root backwards).
4. Open a command terminal. Run the following command to set the IP address and subnet mask.

```
ifconfig eth0 192.168.2.5 netmask 255.255.255.0
ifconfig
```

The output of `ifconfig` should look similar to the following figure. The IP address and subnet mask should match.

== Note About Network Adapters

If the network adapter for your Kali virtual machine is set to `NAT`, you will be able to connec to the internet but not other virtual machines. If your network adapter is set to `internal network`, you will be able to connect Kali to other virtual machines but not the internet directly.

== Troubleshooting Kali

If the internet connection is not working. Try the following:

1. Ensure that the network adapter is set to `NAT` in VirtualBox.
2. In VirtualBox, disable the network adapter the enable the network adapter. This is sometimes helpful if a virtual machine has been suspended.
