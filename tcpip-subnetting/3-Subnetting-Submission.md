Exercise 5: Subnetting
==========================

Questions (Submit answers to these questions along with screen shots of the lab)
---------------

1\) What is a subnet?

2\) What is a subnet mask?

3\) If two computers are not on the same subnet, what is needed in order to communicate?

4\) Write the CIDR notation for the 255.224.0.0 subnet.

CIDR:

5\) Are the IP addresses 192.168.24.85/27 and 192.168.24.96/27 on the same subnetwork? Create a table with the network addresses, first valid host, last valid host, and broadcast address to support your answer.

6\) A Google employee in Mountain View, California has an IP address of 192.168.0.1/24, and an IBM employee in Beijing has an IP address of 192.168.0.2/24. These host addresses are in the same subnet network address space. Will these employees' machines be able to communicate? Explain your answer.

7\) What error message did you receive in response to your `ping 192.1268.100.24` when Bob and Alice were on different subnets, and you had deleted the default route? Briefly explain what this error means.

8\) BONUS: (yes, bonus - +5pts). Move bob to a different network and get bob and alice to be able to ping each other. Prove to me that you got this working.
