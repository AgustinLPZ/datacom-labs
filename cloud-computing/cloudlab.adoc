This lab is to introduce Cloud Computing using the AWS Cloud environment from Amazon. In this lab, you will not be responsible for setting up your own AWS environment. Use your AWS Educate account (or your own personal account if that is the route you took). When you first login to AWS, you will see the AWS dashboard. This is all of the services that are provided via your account. On the dashboard, clicking on the EC2 link. This link will enable us to launch a virtual machine (instance) in the AWS environment.

************************************************************
&nbsp;

You will set up a virtual server in this lab via the following:

.Launch Instance

Click the Launch Instance button

&nbsp;
************************************************************
&nbsp;

Choose the first Amazon AMI. This is a distribution of Linux specific to Amazon.

&nbsp;
************************************************************
&nbsp;

You have many options for the size of your virtual machine. Choose the t2.micro free tier and click Next. 

.Instance Details

&nbsp;
************************************************************
&nbsp;

Configure Details -- Notice the choices under subnet. Choose a specific subnet and write down the name of the subnet becasue you will be creating another virtual machine and you will be placing it in the same subnet --> and click Next.

&nbsp;

On the review page, when you click Launch, you are asked to Create/Choose/Select a key pair. 

.Launch

&nbsp;
************************************************************
&nbsp;

Create a new key pair and enter your name for the key pair and download them. Then Click Launch!!

************************************************************
&nbsp;

You can return to my EC2 Dashboard and find your machine running (you can identify via the key that you just created in the Key Column). In the name column, also name your machine. 

.View Instances
image::IMG11.png[View Instances]

&nbsp;
************************************************************
&nbsp;

On the instances dashboard, you will first see only one new instance. REPEAT ALL THE STEPS to create a second instance that is on the same subnet and uses the same security group. 

.Create Second Identical Instance

&nbsp;
************************************************************
&nbsp;

This screen shows you how you can simply assign the second computer to an existing security group. You created this exisiting security group when you created the first instance.

Great job!! You've created to virtual machines in AWS using a variety of different tools. Now copy your Public IP address or your public IPv4 DNS. You will use these to SSH into both of your running machines. I showed how to do this in earlier class videos ;) 

.Copy Connection Information

&nbsp;
************************************************************
&nbsp;

Once you have connected to both machines, trying pinging each other. Should this work? They are on the same subnets.

QUESTION TO CONSIDER FOR THE FINAL: 

* Explain what is going on resource-wise in this lab. How are resources currently being distributed and managed? Are you an administrator? Could you provide a virtual server for a friend or colleague?
