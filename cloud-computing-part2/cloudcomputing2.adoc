This lab is intended to give you just a bit more insight with respect to AWS cloud computing. In this lab, you will be setting up two machines and having them talk to (ping) each other. This isn't very difficult but along the way we will make a few observations as to the power you have as an AWS manager -- to both observe and set rules. 

To start, login to your AWS Educate account and make sure you are in the N. Virginia region. This seems to be the region that gives us the resources we need. Locate the VPC services. There you will see VPCs along with other services in the VPC dashboard.

 Click on the VPCs link and from there click Create VPC

{nbsp} +
{nbsp} +
 
From there, you will name your VPC. You can name it after yourself if you'd like. In the CIDR block, put some block of local addresses. In this case I put a relatively small block of addresses.

Once you have created the VPC, you will need to create a subnet within that VPC. Click on the Subnets over on the left side, then click Create Subnet. 

.Create Subnet

{nbsp} +
{nbsp} +

In the create subnet screen fill out the appropriate details. In this case, you have to assign the subnet to the VPC that you just created. Also, In this example, the subnet is the size of the VPC (the blocks are the same size).

Now let's create a route. The route will define where traffic can and can't flow in the VPC/subnet. Click Route Tables on the left side and then click Create route table.

{nbsp} +

Like the subnet, you assign the route table to a VPC (whatever you named yours). Pretty easy.

{nbsp} +

At this point, your VPC is starting to get a bit of robustness associated with it. It has a name. It has a subnet. It has a route table. Growing up! Now we need to estabish an Internet Gatewary for your VPC -- so it can go on the internet. Click on Internet Gateways on the left and then click Create Internet Gateway.

{nbsp} +

Name the Internet Gateway and click Create!

{nbsp} +

SUPER IMPORTANT!!! Once you create the gateway, the next screen will ask if you would like to associate the gateway with a VPC (green bar at the top). You must do this -- associating it with your newly created VPC.

Now return to your Route Table and add the newly created Internet Gateway.

We're now ready to create the Peering Connection! Click Peering Connections on the left and then Create peeting connection on the top. The large numbers you see there are the things you are going to need to set up the peering conneciton with your professor. 

.Create Peering Connection

{nbsp} +

Here are the details of the Create Peering Connection page. These should be pretty straightforward. Basically, you are connecting your VPC to the professor's VPC. The details in the bottom must be exactly as they are in this picture

{nbsp} +
{nbsp} +

A little clean-up here at the end. 1) Add the newly created Peering Connection to your list of routes and 2) ensure that your route table is aligned with your subnet.

At this you are really done. You just need to wait for me. On my end, I will see your peering request. I'll do my best to monitor things to accept your requests but it is quite possible that things will timeout (if you do this work at 2am -- send me the request -- and I don't see it until hours later). That's okay as our schedules may be totally off. 

.See Peering Request

{nbsp} +
{nbsp} +

If (when) I accept your peering request, you will see it as Active. If I don't accept your request in time, sorry as I may not have been monitoring things super closely. If that's the case, you'll see a red status marker and it'll say something like timeout. That's okay -- take a picture anyway.

{nbsp} +

That's it. You can stop your services if you'd like. The goal is to get you to see that we can move towards shared resources between you and me. There is more to this story and it is in the video and slides. Once the peering is established, we can talk with one and other on our local networks. There is a bit more work to do on this but it's only a few steps away. Establishing peering is really the key. You have a VPC. I have a VPC. Through peering we can share resources. 

QUESTION TO CONSIDER FOR THE FINAL: 

* Why would someone set up peering? 

* When setting up your route table, why did you have to set up the three different entries? 

* Why does the route table need to be associated with the subnet?
