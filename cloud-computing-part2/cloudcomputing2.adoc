This lab is intended to give you just a bit more insight with respect to AWS cloud computing. In this lab, you will be setting up two machines and having them talk to (ping) each other. This isn't very difficult but along the way we will make a few observations as to the power you have as an AWS manager -- to both observe and set rules. 

To begin, you are going to need to set up 2 virtual machines in the AWS environment. You do this in the exact same way that you did things last week. For each of your servers, create a unique key pair for Server 1 and for Server 2.

The next part is going to be the most important part of setting up your server. You'll see that you can select the subnet that you put your server on. For Server 1, choose the first subnet on the list. For Server 2, select a different subnet. It doesn't matter which one, just make sure that the two are different.

Once you selected the subnet, set a new (uniquely named) security group for each of your machines, enabling ping (ICMP) from anywhere. This will allow the two machines to talk to each other even though they are different subnets.

After you've done this, keep the default setup and launch your machine. Again, create a unique key pair for each machine. Once you've launched the two machines (on different subnets), provide a picture of them in your EC2 dashboard that shows the two machines are on different subnets (Availability Zone).

Once both are launched, login to them (via two terminal windows). Once you have logged in, ping each machine. You should have no trouble if you set everything up correctly.

Once you have successfully pinged the machines, go back to your EC2 dashboard and view your running instances. At the bottom, click the Monitoring tab. This shows you some administrative insight on the work your machines are doing. There is not going to be much here because we are only using these machines for pinging but Monitoring is a great way to see server load.

All right, now we are going to isolate one of the servers from the other. To do this, we are going to modify the inbound security rules that you set earlier. First, we have to note one of the security groups that one of the servers is associated with. Again, you should have two different security groups, one for each server. You'll see the assigned security group over on the right hand side of this picture (security group column). 

.Identify Security Group

Once you've identified one of the security groups, note it down as this is the one we are going to change. Back at the EC2 Dashboard, on the left side, you'll see Security Groups under Network & Security. Click it. 

.Security Groups Link

From there, select the security group you are going to modify in order to restrict access across subnets. 

.Select Security Group to Modify

{nbsp} +
{nbsp} +

After clicking the security group you are going to modify, click "Edit Inbound Rules". This will enable us to restrict what is coming into the server.

.Edit Rules

{nbsp} +
{nbsp} +

From there, you will modify the rule (simply click in the search box) to select the rule 0.0.0.0/32. Delete any additional ICMP rules. Make sure you don't delete your SSH rule.

QUESTION TO CONSIDER FOR THE FINAL: 

* Explain what is going on resource-wise in this lab. How are resources currently being distributed and managed? Are you an administrator? Could you provide a virtual server for a friend or colleague?
