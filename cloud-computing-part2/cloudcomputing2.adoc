This lab is intended to give you just a bit more insight with respect to AWS cloud computing. In this lab, you will be setting up two machines and having them talk to (ping) each other. This isn't very difficult but along the way we will make a few observations as to the power you have as an AWS manager -- to both observe and set rules. 

To begin, you are going to need to set up 2 virtual machines in the AWS environment. You do this in the exact same way that you did things last week. For each of your servers, create a unique key pair for Server 1 and for Server 2.

The next part is going to be the most important part of setting up your server. You'll see that you can select the subnet that you put your server on. For Server 1, choose the first subnet on the list. For Server 2, select a different subnet. It doesn't matter which one, just make sure that the two are different.

Once you selected the subnet, set a new (uniquely named) security group for each of your machines, enabling ping (ICMP) from anywhere. This will allow the two machines to talk to each other even though they are different subnets.

After you've done this, keep the default setup and launch your machine. Again, create a unique key pair for each machine. Once you've launched the two machines (on different subnets), provide a picture of them in your EC2 dashboard that shows the two machines are on different subnets (Availability Zone).

Once both are launched, login to them (via two terminal windows). Once you have logged in, ping each machine. You should have no trouble if you set everything up correctly.

* On the dashboard, note your public IP address below. You will need this to access your machine. Note that this IP address will change every time the server is restarted. Now that you have your server running, you have your pem key, and you have your IP address, you can login to your EC2 machine. 

ON MAC
Use your terminal/command tool to navigate to the folder where your pem key is: 

`$ chmod 400 YourName.pem`

Login to the EC2 instance 
> ssh -i "YourName.pem" ec2-user@your.ip.address.here

ON WINDOWS
Download Putty and PuttyGen. Using PuttyGen you have to convert the pem key that you have to a ppk key that Putty will understand. There is a tutorial provided from Amazon here: 

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/putty.html 

Once you have converted your key to a ppk key, open Putty and in the hostname/address type exactly this: 

ec2-user@your.ip.address

Scroll down to connection-SSH-auth and browse to your newly created ppk key.

* Before you click Open, you should scroll back up to Terminal and name and save your connection so you don’t have to locate your ppk key every time. Click Open. Whether on a Mac or Windows, you are now logged on: 

.EC2 SSH

* Now that you are on your AWS cloud instance, you will revisit few of your prior labs. We are going revisit the Apache Web Server lab. Install the Apache Web Server and run the server on port 80. Note that Amazon Linux uses the ‘sudo yum install httpd’ command and not ‘apt install apache2’ as we have been doing with Ubuntu. 

1)	Install the Apache web server and run the server on port 80
3)  Run -- sudo service httpd start -- to start the server
2)	Show the default home page of the server (include your IP address in the status bar so I can see it align with your AWS dashboard IP address)

* Modify an Apache index.html web page (/var/www) and take a picture of that new page and include that as well. 

QUESTION TO CONSIDER FOR THE FINAL: 

* Explain what is going on resource-wise in this lab. How are resources currently being distributed and managed? Are you an administrator? Could you provide a virtual server for a friend or colleague?
