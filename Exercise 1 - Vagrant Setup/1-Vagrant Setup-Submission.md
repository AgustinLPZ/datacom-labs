2\) What is a virtual machine? (~100 words)

3\) What is SSH? (~50 words)

4\) Vagrant uses private keys to authenticate with the virtual machine.  That is
how you can authenticate to the VM without using a password.  Read
[this question and the first answer from Stack Exchange](https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/33381/ssh-password-vs-key-authentication)
and explain in your own words why you would choose public key over password
authentication.  You might want to do some research on public key cryptography to
help you answer this question.

5\) What does the Windows PATH variable do? (~15-50 words)

6\) What part(s) of this exercise was(were) most confusing? This could be a concept that was not explained clearly, a command that did not work as you expected, or anything else that you think could be improved.
